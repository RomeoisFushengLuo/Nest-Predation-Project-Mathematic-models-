Nest-Predation-Project-Mathematic-models

Outline Introduction

A cooperatively breeding bird species consists of birds that can help raise offspring in neighboring nests, from clutch formation to hatching and feeding the newborns. An example of this kind of species is called Gray-capped Weavers. Some members of this species may drop eggs in unfavorable situations, such as to make room for new eggs when a nest is full or when the egg is unfertilized.
Recently, a new event that triggers egg dropping has been discovered: When predation is high and clutch size becomes too small, some parental Gray-capped Weavers throw their eggs as a strategy to maximize their reproductive success, which is reportedly a new trait in social birds and is referred to as parental tossing.
The hypothesis is that the investment in hatching and nurturing the remaining eggs and neonates of the reduced clutch carries a high risk of not paying off because these neonates may die before hatching or maturing. Thus, grey-capped social weavers would discard these eggs and save energy and resources for the next brood, where the probability of success is higher because the new brood has a larger number of eggs. Another hypothesis is that by discarding their eggs, the birds are depriving predators of key resources, keeping population size under control, and possibly increasing the probability of survival of the future clutch.
The aim of this project is to analyze through a mathematical model the population dynamics of the gray-capped weavers with tossing and non-tossing strategies. In order to construct this mathematical model you are advised to first identify the key dependent variables. One possibility is to construct a system of ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics among the number of eggs (E), the number of birds (B), and the number of predators (P).

I built two different mathematical models to analyse the effect of egg-tossing in nature. Analysing the Hopf-bifurcation points, I conclude that with or with egg-tossing behaviors, the eco-system of Grey-Capped weavers remains stable but with diverse quantities of predators and preys (weaverbirds).
